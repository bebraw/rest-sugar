# rest-sugar - Makes it easy to write yummy REST APIs

The whole point of this library is to make it easy to implement simple
yet powerful REST APIs. There are a few extension points you can hook
into. mongoose-sugar complements this particular library very well.
It is possible to implement similar solutions for other backends too.

Even though the library has been designed based on Express, it might be
possible to make it work with other similar libraries too given they use
Express conventions. This might take some kind of an adapter.

See demo to see how the architecture works out. Note that as it does
not use mongoose-sugar it is a bit lengthy. It should give you some idea
how to implement components that fit the whole, though.
